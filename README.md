# Multi-Language Personal Assistant
Un proiect început din liceu

## Description:
Create a personal assistant application that can perform a wide range of tasks using C++, Java, and Python for different components of the application.
     
## Components:
Voice Recognition (Python): Implement voice recognition using Python libraries like SpeechRecognition to understand spoken commands.

Natural Language Processing (Python): Utilize Python's Natural Language Processing libraries (NLTK or spaCy) to analyze and understand the context of text-based commands.

Task Management (Java): Develop a Java-based task management system to handle to-do lists, appointments, and reminders.

Data Storage (C++): Use C++ to create a data storage module for securely storing user data, such as tasks and preferences.

User Interface (Java): Design a user-friendly interface using Java's Swing or JavaFX for users to interact with the personal assistant.

Integration (Python, Java, C++): Implement communication between the Python voice recognition and natural language processing components, the Java task management and user interface, and the C++ data storage module.

Functionality (Python, Java, C++): Implement various functionalities, such as setting reminders, sending emails, fetching weather updates, and more, utilizing the strengths of each language where appropriate.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the application can run on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) by leveraging the portability of C++, Java, and Python.

Security (C++): Use C++ to handle data encryption and security to protect user data.

This project will provide a comprehensive learning experience and showcase the power of integrating different programming languages to create a functional and versatile personal assistant application. Additionally, it can be expanded over time with new features and integrations.
